Practice creating their own sentences using past tense and relative clauses.
(2) Writing Prompt and Guided Writing (20 minutes)
🎯Objective: Foster creative writing while focusing on the correct use of past tense and relative clauses.

📱Activity:

Provide the following writing prompt:
"In the story, Alex and his friends discovered an ancient treasure in Whispering Hollow and decided to donate the artifacts to the local museum. Have you ever found something valuable or interesting? Write about a similar experience. Describe what you found, what you did with it, and how you felt about your decision. Be sure to use past tense for the events and include at least one relative clause (e.g., 'The book that I found was very old')."

Allow students to write their responses while focusing on using past tense verbs and relative clauses.

👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:

## Lesson Plan

![Final Banner](https://github.com/ShieldEdu/G4-finalproject/blob/main/Images/The_final_banner3.jpg?raw=true)

## Overview
This lesson plan is designed for middle school students and focuses on enhancing listening and writing skills through interactive activities using Gradio and Python coding. The lesson is based on the story "The Guardian's Secret."

## Objectives
- 📚 Improve vocabulary knowledge
- 🎧 Enhance listening comprehension
- 🧩 Develop sequencing skills
- ✍️ Foster creative writing abilities

## Tools Used

**Gradio:** For creating interactive web apps.

**Python:** Programming language for implementing Gradio apps.

**Hugging Face:** A platform providing a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tools and models.

## Teaching Procedure (55 minutes in total)

### 1. 🎧 Listening Activity (35 minutes)

#### (1) Pre-Listening Activity: Learning New Words (10 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Introduce and discuss new vocabulary from the story.

**📱Activity:** Use the Gradio Wordcloud App to create a word cloud highlighting frequent words from the text.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:** Display the word cloud on a projector and discuss the highlighted words with students. Explain meanings, provide examples, and answer any questions.

**👦👧Students' Role:** Participate in the discussion, take notes on new vocabulary, and ask questions about any unfamiliar words.

#### (2) While-Listening Activity (15 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Enhance listening comprehension and focus on past tense verbs.

**📱Activity:**
- Use the Gradio TTS App to convert the text to an audio file. Play the audio for students.
- Provide a cloze exercise using the Gradio Cloze Question App, focusing on past tense verbs. Students fill in the blanks while listening.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Play the audio file and monitor students' progress.
- Distribute the cloze exercise and guide students through it.
- Assist students in using the Verb Base Form App.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Listen to the audio and complete the cloze exercise by filling in the blanks with past tense verbs.
- Use the Verb Base Form App to check their answers and learn the base forms of the verbs.

#### (3) After-Listening Activity: Sequence the Story (10 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Develop sequencing skills by arranging images in the correct order.

**📱Activity:** Use the Gradio Image Sequencing App to provide images related to the story. Students arrange the images in the correct sequence based on what they heard.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Display the images using the Image Sequencing App.
- Guide students through the activity, asking them to justify their choices.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Work individually or in pairs to arrange the images in the correct sequence.
- Discuss and explain their reasoning for the order they chose.

### 2. ✍️ Writing Activity (20 minutes)

**🎯Objective:** Foster creative writing and check for grammatical accuracy.

**📱Activity:**
- Provide the following writing prompt: "In the story, Alex and his friends discovered an ancient treasure in Whispering Hollow and decided to donate the artifacts to the local museum. In the past, did you have a similar experience where you found something valuable or interesting? Tell the story. Describe what you found, what you did with it, and how you felt about your decision. Remember to use past tense in your writing. Provide reasons for your opinions and try to relate them to the values and lessons from the story."
- Use the Gradio Writing Checker App to allow students to check their writing for errors.

**👨‍🏫Teacher's Role:**
- Introduce the writing prompt and explain the task.
- Assist students in using the Writing Checker App to review and correct their writing.

**👦👧Students' Role:**
- Write a response to the prompt.

**<Synopsis>**
In Echo Ridge, a mountain village enriched with legends of the "Guardian of the Glen" eagle, adventurous Alex discovers an ancient map in a library book that hints at a hidden treasure in Whispering Hollow cave. Along with friends Mia and Sam, Alex embarks on a challenging expedition through dense forests and rugged terrain. Upon reaching the cave, they find not gold, but historical artifacts including a statuette of the Guardian eagle, which they donate to the local museum. This discovery not only cements their status as local heroes but revitalizes the village's interest in its own lore and history, continuing the legend of the Guardian as a symbol of adventure and cultural heritage.
