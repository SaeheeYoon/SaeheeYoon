📱Activity:
Provide the following writing prompt:
"In the story, Alex and his friends discovered an ancient treasure in Whispering Hollow and decided to donate the artifacts to the local museum. Have you ever found something valuable or interesting? Write about a similar experience. Describe what you found, what you did with it, and how you felt about your decision. Be sure to use past tense for the events and include at least one relative clause (e.g., 'The book that I found was very old')."

2. Closing Activity: Final Edits and Reflection (10 minutes)

🎯Objective: Reflect on the writing process and make final edits.
